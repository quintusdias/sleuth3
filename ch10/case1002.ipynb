    "To orient themselves with respect to their surroundings, some bats use echolocation.  They send out pulses and read the echos that are bounced back from surrounding objects.  Such a trait has evolved in very few animal species, perhaps because of the high energy involved in producing pulses.  Because flight also requires a great deal of energy, zoologists wondered whether the combined energy costs of echolocation and flight in bats was the sum of the flight energy costs and the at-rest echolocation energy costs, or whether the bats had developed a means of echolocation in flight that made the combined energy cost less than the sum."
