The median starting salary for females was estimated to be only 89% of the median salary for males, after accounting for the variables measured above (a 95% confidence interval for the ratio of adjusted medians is 85% to 93%).   There is little evidence that the pay increases for females differed from those for males (one-sided $p$-value  0.27 from a $t$-test for the difference in mean log of average annual raise; one-sided $p$-value = 0.72 after further adjustment for other variables except beginning salary; one-sided $p$-value = 0.033 after further adjustment for other variables including beginning salary)."
