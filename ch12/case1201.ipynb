    "# State Average SAT Scores - An Observational Study\n",
    "\n",
    "When, in 1982, average Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) scores were first published on a state-by-state basis in the United States, the huge variation in the scores was a source of great pride for some states and of consternation for others.  Average scores ranged from a low of 790 (out of a possible 1,600) in South Carolina to a high of 1,088 in Iowa.  This 298-point spread dwarfed the 20-year national decline of 80 points.  Two researchers set out to \"assess the extent to which the compositional/demographic and school-structural characteristics are implicated in SAT differences.\"  (Data from B. Powell and L. C. Steelman, \"Variations in State SAT Performance:  Meaningful or Misleading?\"  *Harvard Educational Review* 54(4) (1984): 389-412.)\n",

    "The state averages of the local SAT (verbal + quantitative) scores are listed below, along with six variables that may be associated with the SAT differences among states.  Some explanatory variables come from the Powell and Steelman article, while others were obtained from the College Entrance Examination Board (by Robert Powers).  The variables are the following:  *Takers* is the percentage of the total eligible students (high school seniors) in the state who took the exam; *income* is the median income of families of test-takers, in hundreds of dollars; *years* is the average number of years that the test-takers, in hundreds of dollars; *years* is the number of years that the test-takers had formal studies in social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities; *public* is the percentage of the test-takers who attended public secondary schools; *expend* is the total state expenditure on secondary schools, expressed in hundreds of dollars per student; and *rank* is the median percentile ranking of the test-takers within their secondary school classes."
